The book details many arcane and powerful magics, mostly to cause severe
pain to other beings. In a flowing hand is written
  
Fireball      (Free cremation included)
        A potent piece of magic much dependant upon the power of the caster
        as to the damage it does, although sulphur enhances this.
Missile       
        A similar magic much popular amongst mages. It is said that magical
        talismans may be created to aid this spell
Shock   (Normally fairly shocking too)
        A spell of touch, which can pass through metal armours with great ease
        A decent caster never uses this as a party trick....
        Lodestones help with its casting
  
Any mage should beware as castings of magics though potent will drain the 
strength of the casters.
