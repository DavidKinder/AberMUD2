The runes are apparently part of an educational guide to spell casting and
list several basic pieces of magic, these are
Deafen <person>, Dumb <person> Cripple <person> and Cure <person>
the runes also allude to a spell for summoning people, but note that
several amulets and talismans can protect the victim from its effects.
