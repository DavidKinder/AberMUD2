The Treasury
    You are standing in the dwarven treasury. A large and very well protected
room that few are privileged to see. A single door leads east.
    There is a charred shape on the wall, somewhat resembling an ex neccy Moog
and scratched on the wall you see the words 'Die Frog...the ex knight to be!'.
A third notice reads "Whos he ? - Knknkqqkl"
