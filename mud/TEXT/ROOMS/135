Lava Cavern
    You are in a huge cavern. The walls glow and pulse with an intense red
light, reflected up from a river of lava which flows sluggishly westwards at the
south end of the cavern. Huge explosions of lava regularly light up the cavern
to an extent that the light is almost blinding, accompanied by almost deafening
explosions. A path leads down almost suicidally close to the lava river.
Exits: North,Down.
