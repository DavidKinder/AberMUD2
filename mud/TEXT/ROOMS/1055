The Outer Hall
    You stand in the shadowy outer hall, lit only by flaming torches high,
out of reach on the walls. The dim flickering light illuminates the many
doorways which lead north, south, east and west.
    A cold draught blows through the hall, from the grand, heavily carved
archway, which looks out northwards across the courtyard, its high
thick walls silhouetted in the torch light.
