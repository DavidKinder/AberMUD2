Gate Of Sorcerors
    You are outside The Gate Of Sorcerors. It's mighty pillars tower up
between you, shielding you from the worst of the snow that is falling and from
some of the icy winds. The ancient arched gateway between the pillars leads
north into a wide magically lit passage which disappears into the roots of
the earth.
    Apart from the exit north through the gate, you can trudge in any direction
through the snows
