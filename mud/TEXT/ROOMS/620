Eastern Side Of Valley
    You are standing amidst some trees on the eastern edge of the valley. The
forest continues to the north south and west, although a deep stream bars any
exit west. To the east the trees thin out rapidly, giving way to a steep bare
rocky rise.
    A rope ladder leads up one of the trees.
