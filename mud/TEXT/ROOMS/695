Path
    You are following a narrow winding path off the moors, leading south
towards some steps. The view southwards from here is breathtaking, as the 
steps are at the edge of a steep drop, giving you a superb vantage upon the
wild misty mountains. The peaks soar high around you, walling in a wide valley.
The lush green of the valley deep below, and the glittering of water contrast
superbly with the snowy cloud veiled mountain tops, a stunning picture that you
could contemplate for hours....
