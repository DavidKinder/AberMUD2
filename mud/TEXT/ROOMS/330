Top Of West Tower
    You are in a small room at the top of the west tower. It looks out across
a vast expanse of land. As your eyes wander across the skyline you can
pick out the desert of fools, the valley and the black tower far in the
distance. Clearly this is the dwarven watch post in times of war.
Stairs lead down.
