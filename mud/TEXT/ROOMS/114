Pentacle Hall
    You are in a huge pillared hall deep within the mountain. Huge ornately
carved pillars support the millions of tons of rock above me. Sinister and
rather ugly gargoyles protrude from the pillars gazing centrally towards a mass
of mystical symbols which are engraved all over the floor.
