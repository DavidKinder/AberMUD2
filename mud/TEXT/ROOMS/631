End Of Valley
    You are at the southern end of the valley, The trees continue north east and
west from here, but to the south everything ends in a huge black cliff, which
soars high up above you at close to vertical for several hundred feet. On its
top your eyes seem to catch the flicker of something glittering.
    A narrow rocky crack leads south down the narrowing gap between the cliffs
