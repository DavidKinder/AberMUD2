Stonewalled Chamber
    You are in a small stonewalled chamber. Light streams in through a
somewhat vandalised window, to the north is another darker chamber only
partially lit from the window, while to the south through a doorway veiled in
deep shadow you can see a dark passage.
     The window is east.
