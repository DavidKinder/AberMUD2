The Village Church
    You are in the villages small wooden church. A gentle breeze blows into
the church disturbing the dust which dances in the sunbeams that shine faintly
through the windows. A doorway leads south.
    There is a sacrificial pit in the floor into which you can drop items
in search of blessings from the gods.
