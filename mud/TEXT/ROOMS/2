Workmans Store
    This room appears to have been especialy created for all the trash
that inevitably gets created in a new planet without somewhere for it to
go. However due to local bureaucracy the first of the items is yet to 
appear, they appear to have been misdirected to limbo instead !
 
 
    A note in glowing runes hangs in mid air here simply saying :
                   Bloody customs and excise.
                               ----*(A)
