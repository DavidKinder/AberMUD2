Bottom Of The Mine
    You are standing at the bottom of a treacherous ladder which climbs up
a narrow vertical shaft. To your west you can crawl along a low heavily shored
up tunnel towards a face. Another ladder leads down further but it is rotted
and descends only about ten feet before it  dissappears beneath water, into 
the flooded depths of the mine.
    To judge from the moss and slime on the wall this part of the mine is often
flooded too.
