The Cliff Steps
    You are standing on a set of narrow winding steps carved into the side of
a steep cliff face. The steps descend down as far as you can see, and 
contemplating them for a long time leaves you feeling giddy. The steps lead
upwards to the lip of the cliff. To the east but well beyond your jumping
ability you can see a wide ledge and what appears to be a cavemouth.
