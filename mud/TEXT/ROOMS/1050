Bugiits Leap
    You stand at the top of a tall cliff looking north, down into a deep
valley. Huge rocks at the bottom offer the delights of total oblivion, to
become another smashed wreck at its base.
    If you are in no hurry, a narrow cliff path also leads down to the north
descending down a fissure in the cliff itself.
  To the south a path runs towards a large castle with a threatening black
tower, whilst to the west is an old watchtower.
