Shady Clearing
    You are in a shady clearing surrounded by proud and mighty oaks. The
oaks are surrounded by hollies and thick bushes, while creepers and
weeds girdle their ancient trunks.
    A single huge stone stands in the centre of the clearing, its sides
strangely marked and scored.
    The only route from the clearing is a single path winding north, worn
into a deep rut by the passing of endless footsteps.
