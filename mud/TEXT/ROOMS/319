The Dwarven Dining Hall
    This huge hall is another tribute to the skilled stonework of the dwarves
A circular hall with a spectacular painted domed roof that seems lost in 
the shadows high above you. From the walls spectacularly carved gargoyles
leer down attempting to put you off your food.
Passages lead north east and west.
