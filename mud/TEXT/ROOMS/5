The Temple Of Paradise
    You stand in the temple of paradise, a huge stone structure whose walls
are decorated with ancient carvings and runes, some so old that even the 
priests no longer know their meanings. 
    A single set of steps lead south descending the huge mound upon which
the temple is built into the forests below.
    At your feet a huge sacrificial pit allows you to give valuables to the
gods in the hope of being rewarded.
