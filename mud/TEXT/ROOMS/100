Blizzard Pass
    You are trudging through deep snow as you follow a narrow track that
winds down a long pass leading ever southwards, it's end is hidden by the
flurries of snow that are still falling. Either side of you the mountains tower
above the pass, with the high peaks veiled in cloud. At one point however the
cliff is nowhere near as steep and a fair way up a single window is cut into the
cliff, looking out across the snows.
