Escape passage
    This is a passageway which would be used by the King and his court if the
castle defence was ever penetrated, to escape from the attackers, and looking
at the lack of dust and cobwebs it would seem to have been used recently.
The passage is small and dark, but probably more inviting than the wrong
end of a sword, and at the moment it leads to a sparkling portal which
would lead onto Xanadu but is closed for Spring cleaning!
