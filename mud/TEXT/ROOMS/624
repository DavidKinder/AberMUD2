Pool
    You are standing beside a small , smooth pool, fed from a
stream which runs in from the north. The cool shallow waters of the pool 
flicker and dance with the breeze, reflecting the swaying trees, and the
tiny dark specks of the thousands of insects which dart back and forth 
around you.
    Paths lead through the forest in all directions from here.
