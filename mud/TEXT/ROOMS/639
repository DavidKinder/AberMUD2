By The Altar
    You are standing beside the altar, now barely recognizable, a smashed and
aged pile of rotten wood and fabrics, hiding mossy stonework beneath. A set of
steps lead up to the east, probably to the church tower. The main church hall
is north , and to the south you can go behind the altar.
