Crevasse
    You are standing on the edge of a deep crevasse looking down into
darkness. Heavy snow is falling all around you partially hiding the distant
mountains in clouds of whiteness
    The snows extend in all direction save east, where the crevasse bars
the route.
    You could clamber down into the crevasse but would have great problems in
getting back out of it.
