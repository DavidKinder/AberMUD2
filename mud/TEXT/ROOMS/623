Forest Track
    You are following a track which leads north through the forest towards
a humpbacked bridge. The track seems to form here from myriads of tiny trails
which lead in all directions through the trees.
    A wide paved path winds up a huge mound set amongst the trees. On the
top of the mound you can make out a temple of some sort.
