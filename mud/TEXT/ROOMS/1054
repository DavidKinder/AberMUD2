The Central Courtyard
    You stand in the central courtyard of a huge, and ancient castle,
flickering torches set high around the walls, illuminate even the darkest
corners with a reddish flickering glow. A huge archway leads north, its sides
carved with fantastic images of dragons and fables.
Arched entryways lead south east and west.
