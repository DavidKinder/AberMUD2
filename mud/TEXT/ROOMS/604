North End Of Valley
    You are at the northern end of a steep mountainous valley. The valley 
extends away southwards as far as you can see, flanked on each side by the
mighty mountain peaks towering into the clouds.
    A narrow gulley leads west up the side of a cliff, climbing at a dangerous
looking angle towards the top.
