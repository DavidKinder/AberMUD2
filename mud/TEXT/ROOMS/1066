Guard Room
    You find yourself in the guard room for the castle. Bunks line the
walls, and weapon racks stand in the centre of the room, though they are
all empty now. Judging by the upturned tables and chairs and the dried 
blood on the floor you think that the guards may not have left on a
Sunday afternoon stroll.
     A single narrow doorway leads east.
