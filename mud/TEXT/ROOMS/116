Shattered Hall
    You are in a shattered hall. Huge scorch marks and strange burns appear
to indicate a tremendous amount of powerful sorcery was used in here, indeed
sufficient to blow huge chunks out of the wall, indeed the passage
to the east is now unreachable, as a huge fissure has opened up in the floor.
