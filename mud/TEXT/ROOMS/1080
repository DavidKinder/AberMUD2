Sorcerers Room
    You are in a very large and exceedingly magical room, devoted to the
pursuit of magic in all its form. Flames dance over the walls to light
the scene, although they are merely for effect as a permanent fire fountain
erupts from the centre of the room producing no sound. Gargoyles wink at you
from the walls and objects move quietly in complex patterns in the corners
getting on with the jobs they have been given. 
    There is a door to the south, and a doorway leads west. A splendid arched
window looks east across the world.
