Top Of Barrow
    You stand on the top of a huge barrow. A single path leads back to the west
A huge stone pillar stands on the centre of the barrow marked with the words
                   Born To Live
                   Bound To Die
                   Born To Love
                   Bound To Cry
                   Born To Win
                   Bound To Lose
                   Peace At Last
                   Death Not Gloom
