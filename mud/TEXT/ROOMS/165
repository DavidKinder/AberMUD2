The Temple
    You are in a sinister temple. Hideous shapes seem to reach out of
nothingness towards you and vanish as immaterial shadows. The whole room
radiates a crushing sense of power filling you with awe and dread. A huge fire
burns at an end of the temple, seemingly without a source.
Doorways lead North and East.
