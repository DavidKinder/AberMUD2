    You are in a large rocky and very uneven cave. A smooth path has been
cut across the floor permitting easy walking. The whole cave is filled with a
thundering roar which reaches deep into your mind. A huge, deep and steep-walled
channel full of lava prevents you from going east through a huge gateway.
