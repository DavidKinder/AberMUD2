Oak Forest
    You are walking through well spaced oak trees, whose low tangled branches
reach out around you, confusing the light and rustling quietly in the wind.
    The forest extends in all direction save from the north, where it stops
abruptly, cut short by a massive towering cliff. To the west there seems to
be a clearing.
    A path climbs up the cliff side to the north.
