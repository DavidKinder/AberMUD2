Magical item storeroom
    You are standing in a large storeroom which would be packed with 
magical artefacts in normal times but it seems that the Sorcerer is using
their power for a large spell project that crackles from the top most
level of the tower.
    A doorway leads through to the east to the wraith room, and you tremble
at the thought of the creature which may lie through it, a creature which
has been known to slay even enchanters in but a single blow.....
