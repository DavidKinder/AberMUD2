Narrow Gulley
    You are clambering through a narrow rocky gulley, the floor of which
is sloping at an angle of almost 45 degrees. Shale and loose stone make
the gulley treacherous, as your feet send bits of rock tumbling down into
the valley below.
    You can clamber up the gulley towards a turning or down it towards
the valley floor.
