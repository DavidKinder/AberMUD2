Inner Sanctum
    This is the stately room where the Lords and Ladies of court would
wait to be entertained by the King of the Castle, although now the
tapestries hang in shreds on the walls and all the treasures that once 
stood on pedastals have been smashed or stolen... it would appear
that the castle has been raided and the King overthrown.
    Archways lead North and South.
