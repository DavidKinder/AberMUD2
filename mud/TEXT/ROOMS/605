Northern End Of Valley
    You are near the northern end of the valley. The dark mountains close
up around you to the north, although a narrow track for some reason leads
north right towards the very end of the valley. Elsewhere around you the
view is obscured by trees, although from the south you can hear the musical
tinkle of water.
