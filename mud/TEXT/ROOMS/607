Forests Edge
    You stand on the edge of the forest, which extends south east and west as
far as you can see. To the north the trees give way to a grassy hill. A narrow
worn path leads north up the hill.
    To the south the path through the forest is almost blocked by thick
hedges, but a few gaps enable you to squeeze through.
