Graveyard
    You are standing at the southern end of the graveyard, following a path
which leads north, beside a stone wall. To the south is the churchyard, and
the old church itself. To the west a worn rut in the grass leads out across
some marshy ground, past a sign which reads "Danger Marshland".
