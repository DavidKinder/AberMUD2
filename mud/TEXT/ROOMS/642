The Stairs
    You are climbing a set of steep , slippery stairs that lead up into the
church tower. Water runs down the steps, collecting in mossy pools, where
the cracks and dips in the stonework allow it. The steps turn from stone to
wood up above, and look very dodgy.
    To the west a doorway leads out into the pulpit.
