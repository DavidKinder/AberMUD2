Finally we would like to thank the following people

Chris Samuel 	Who wrote much of the debugging utilities for the original
"Judge Death"	Honeywell version of AberMUD

Robert Ash	Our Honeywell system manager whose advice on the original
"SYS$MAN"	Honeywell version has proved invaluble, and whos comments
		that it was not possible started this whole crazy lark

Lorry The ArchWizard
		For the idea of SETIN SETOUT ....

Arthur The Button
		And other mindless amusements which kept us happily insane

Life
		Without which it would be a) impossible and b) pretty pointless

Dave Price	Our Unix Support squad, who very kindy conveniently overlooked
Tim Cairnes	the huge amounts of filestore that I have been using recently,
Gavin Harrold	to develop the game system

And all the many people who have played the game, giving it life and meaning
and whose invaluble comments have helped to improve the game system, and
who have proved beyond doubt that I can't spell suddenely
